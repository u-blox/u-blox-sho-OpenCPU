EVK NORA-B2
###########

Overview
********

.. note::

   All software for the NORA-B2 module is experimental and hardware availability
   is restricted to the participants in the limited sampling program.
   This board definition is preliminary. Tested using Zephyr samples blinky,
   blinky_pwm, button. Other interfaces are untested.

The NORA-B2 module is built on the nRF54L15 SoC from Nordic Semiconductor.

The Development Kit hardware provides support for the Nordic Semiconductor
nRF54L15 Arm Cortex-M33 CPU and the following devices:

* :abbr:`SAADC (Successive Approximation Analog to Digital Converter)`
* CLOCK
* RRAM
* :abbr:`GPIO (General Purpose Input Output)`
* :abbr:`TWIM (I2C-compatible two-wire interface master with EasyDMA)`
* MEMCONF
* :abbr:`MPU (Memory Protection Unit)`
* :abbr:`NVIC (Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller)`
* :abbr:`PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)`
* :abbr:`GRTC (Global real-time counter)`
* Segger RTT (RTT Console)
* :abbr:`SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface)`
* :abbr:`UARTE (Universal asynchronous receiver-transmitter)`
* :abbr:`WDT (Watchdog Timer)`

Hardware
********

EVK NORA-B2 has two crystal oscillators:

* High-frequency 32 MHz crystal oscillator (HFXO, module internal). Please
  refer to NORA-B2 SIM for information about internal capacitor settings.
* Low-frequency 32.768 kHz crystal oscillator (LFXO)

The LFXO crystal oscillator can be configured to use either
internal or external capacitors.

Programming and Debugging
*************************

Applications for the ``ubx_evknorab2/nrf54l15/cpuapp`` board can be
built, flashed, and debugged in the usual way. See
:ref:`build_an_application` and :ref:`application_run` for more details on
building and running.

Applications for the ``ubx_evknorab2/nrf54l15/cpuflpr`` board target need
to be built as multicore configuration with code snippet called ``vpr_launcher``
for the application core.

Enter the following command to compile ``hello_world`` for the FLPR core::
 west build -p -b ubx_evknorab2/nrf54l15/cpuflpr --sysbuild -- -DSB_VPR_LAUNCHER=y

Flashing
========

As an example, this section shows how to build and flash the :ref:`hello_world`
application.

.. warning::

   When programming the device, you might get an error similar to the following message::

    ERROR: The operation attempted is unavailable due to readback protection in
    ERROR: your device. Please use --recover to unlock the device.

   This error occurs when readback protection is enabled.
   To disable the readback protection, you must *recover* your device.

   Enter the following command to recover the core::

    west flash --recover

   The ``--recover`` command erases the flash memory and then writes a small binary into
   the recovered flash memory.
   This binary prevents the readback protection from enabling itself again after a pin
   reset or power cycle.

Follow the instructions in the :ref:`nordic_segger` page to install
and configure all the necessary software. Further information can be
found in :ref:`nordic_segger_flashing`.

To build and program the sample to the EVK NORA-B2, complete the following steps:

First, connect the EVK to you computer using the USB port on the EVK.
Next, build the sample by running the following command:

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: ubx_evknorab2/nrf54l15/cpuapp
   :goals: build flash

Testing the LEDs and buttons in the EVK-NORA-B2
***********************************************

Test the EVK NORA-B2 with a :zephyr:code-sample:`blinky` sample or a 
:zephyr:code-sample:`buttons` sample.
