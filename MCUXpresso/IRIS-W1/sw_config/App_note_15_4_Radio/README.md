# Steps to Run the ot-cli Application on the u-blox Module (802.15.4 Applications)

This guide outlines the steps to compile and run the `ot-cli` application on the u-blox module.

## 1. Check the Memory Type

Identify the memory type on your board. Options include:

- **Fidelex**
- **Macronix**

The memory type determines the required binaries for later steps.

## 2. Compile the ot-cli Application

### 2.1. Clone the Repository

Run the following commands to obtain the source code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NXP/ot-nxp.git -b v1.4.0-pvw1
cd ot-nxp
git submodule update --init
./script/bootstrap
```

Refer to the [NXP/ot-nxp GitHub Repository](https://github.com/NXP/ot-nxp/blob/release/v1.4.0/src/rw/rw612/README.md) for more information.

### 2.2. Initialize and Update the SDK

Navigate to the SDK path and execute:

```bash
cd <path-to-ot-nxp>/third_party/github_sdk/
west init -l manifest --mf west.yml
west update
cd <path-to-ot-nxp>
git submodule update --init
```

### 2.3. Update Flash Configuration Files

Replace the following files with u-blox-specific versions:

- **flash_config.c**:  
  Location: `ot-nxp/boards/rw612/rw612_rd/`

Refer to this updated files at [flash_config](../flash_config/)

- **mflash_drv.c**:  
  Location: `ot-nxp/third_party/github_sdk/core/components/flash/mflash/rdrw612bga/`

Refer to this updated files at [flash_drv](../flash_drv/)

### 2.4. Update Calibration Files

Replace the following files with u-blox-specific versions:

- **fwk_config.h**:
  Location: `ot-nxp/third_party/github_sdk/middleware/wireless/framework/platform/rw61x/configs/`

- **fwk_platform_ble.c**:
  Location: `ot-nxp/third_party/github_sdk/middleware/wireless/framework/platform/rw61x/`

Refer to this updated files: [SDK_24_12_00](../BT_802_15_4_Calibration_Files/SDK_24_12_00/), [SDK_2_16_100](../BT_802_15_4_Calibration_Files/SDK_2_16_100/), [SDK_2_16_000](../BT_802_15_4_Calibration_Files/SDK_2_16_000/)

### 2.5. Build the Application

Build the `ot-cli` application:

```bash
./script/build_rw612 ot_cli
```

### 2.6. Flash the Binaries

Flash the compiled binaries to the module:

- **ot_cli binary**: Address `0x08000400`
- **Combo firmware**: Address `0x085e0000`

---

## 3. Set Annex Parameters

To develop a custom 802.15.4 radio application, it is essential to ensure that the calibration and EUI64 values are configured in accordance with the specifications of the IRIS modules.

### 3.1. Use Annex 100 for Calibration

Update the radio calibration settings for the u-blox module, as mentioned in the [Update Calibration Files](#24-update-calibration-files) section.

### 3.2. Configure Annex 104 for Additional Parameters

Utilize the radio_cli.c file located at:`ot-nxp/examples/utils/cli_addons/platform/radio_cli.c`. The following commands can be used within the ot-cli to set the MAC address and TX power limit:

Example `ot-cli` commands:

- **Set EUI64 (MAC Address):**

```bash
radio_nxp seteui64 0xAA001122334455BB
```

- **Set TX Power Limit:**

```bash
radio_nxp txpwrlimit 15
```
