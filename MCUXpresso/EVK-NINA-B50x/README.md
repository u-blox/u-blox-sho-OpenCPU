# EVK-NINA-B50


## General information

This example is based on the led_blinky example from the MCUXpresso SDK.

Please configure the SDK for the K32W148EVK and import the led_blinky example. Replace the relevant source files with the files in this repository.

**NOTE:** The pin-mux files in this folder are an example and does not immediately fit with all examples in the MCUXpresso SDK. In some of the examples the relevant pin definitions may be in other files, and this needs to be checked per example.

The code in the example_code folder illustrates how to access the production parameters saved on the flash during module
production. For more information refer to the [NINA-B50 System Integration Manual](https://www.u-blox.com/docs/UBX-22021116).
